My sump pump was not working, he identified the problem quickly. My float had gone bad, he replaced the float with one he had at his shop so there was no ordering parts. Works perfectly now, he even took the time to fix one of my toliets. He was very professional and just a really nice guy. The price was better than I expected especially with the time and effort it took. Will definitely be using his services in the future.",

      "text": "Update:\nThere are these guys, Clay and Rich, who don\u2019t know what they are doing in all but the simplest of repairs, and Salser recommended them to me when I had called them about a stopped up drain under our house overflowing onto the ground.  They overcharge, knowing they can, because most of their work is in Birmingham. They say they are with Salser Plumbing, but they ask for checks to be made out to their own names. I just spoke directly with Salser and he did admit recommending Clay to me and giving me his number. Yet Salser denies any responsibility for Clay\u2019s work or his associates. I can not verify the quality of work that Salser does, they have yet to come out to service us. I would say make sure you are calling Salser. Also, I cannot emphasize the importance of educating yourself on plumbing repairs.  Watch a YouTube video and do it yourself before you let Clay or Rich handle anything but snaking out a line. Do it yourself, if possible. We found ourselves in a tragic circumstance with this last repair, Clay and his associate did not come through, yet demanded payment before we could even get home from our grandson\u2019s funeral to check the repair, which was not done properly or according to our specific instructions. It is now leaking copiously again, as we told them it would. I hope to give Salser themselves a chance to redeem their good name. Mr Salser states he will no longer recommend Clay. I hope he doesn\u2019t.",

We are sorry that you had a bad experience with Clay and Rich but that does not warrant a bad review for our business.\n\nMark, apparently you have posted this review under the wrong company. Salser Plumbing has not done any work for you, and we also do not have any employees by the names of Clay and Rich. So we would appreciate it if you would delete your review as it does not pertain to Salser Plumbing. Most of our work is in Shelby county as well as Talladega so if you ever need a good reputable plumber, please give us a call. Sorry that you had a bad experience with your plumber.",
