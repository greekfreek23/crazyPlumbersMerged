Blake showed me the possible causes of the leak, and then provided me with different options for the repair. He gave me a reasonable price, so we scheduled the job. He arrived ON TIME and was ready to get to work thinking the whole faucet would need to be replaced and the tile would need to be cut out. Once he started the job, he was HONEST and explained that some simple parts were all that were needed to repair the leak which LOWERED the cost significantly. He is organized, and the invoice was easy to pay right then by credit card with an instant digital receipt for my records.",

I tried to find someone who could come soon to find the leak and fix it. Many plumbers do not return calls or are booked out for days. Jonathan at Machen did return my call and said to call Cochran Brothers. I am so glad I did! He came out the very next morning at 8:30 and said it was the toilet tank upstairs. He replaced the toilet that same morning. We will always use Cochran for our plumbing problems.\nAnother handyman had looked upstairs and wanted to tear out the tile wall. I am so glad we didn't do that! It's best to call a licensed plumber and I recommend Cochran Brothers.",
