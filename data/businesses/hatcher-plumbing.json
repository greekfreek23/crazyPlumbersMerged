He gutted the old drains and replaced all of the cast iron with a completely redesigned pvc drain system all the way to the septic tank.  He designed a new vent system so that no pipes would show up through the roof sections at the front of the house. He also created a new water supply system throughout the house using PEX. He even replaced some pvc on our pool pump! Sims gave a lot of great advice along the way and helped us overcome several obstacles in our remodeling. We will be having him return shortly to hook up all of the fixtures as soon as the drywall is complete. Sims is very personable and passionate about doing quality work.  Hatcher Plumbing has done us a fantastic service!",
