Ron came in and said he was giving me a discount. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. He became angry, threatened to disconnect my gas and said don\u2019t pay me anything! He then paused and asked if I was going to pay him anything. I thought $125 was fair and paid him that.I had to threaten to call the gas company to finally get them to leave. I am also looking into seeing how to report him to the better business bureau along with anything else to warn consumers of his tactics.",
