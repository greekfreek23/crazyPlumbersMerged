We called him after receiving a ridiculous installation quote from our normal plumbers, and Josh did excellent work for a more reasonable price.  He showed up on time.  He was very kind and professional.  He didn\u2019t leave a mess.  I realized that the plumbing he had to connect to was wonky because of a previous bad installation, but he did not complain and he handled the challenge with ease and got everything working in no time.  We will absolutely use Josh from now on for all plumbing work, and we recommend him highly.  It was a stroke of luck to find him.",
