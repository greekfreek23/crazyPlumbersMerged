      "text": "I would not recommend. The guy comes 4+ hours late. I had to continue to contact the guy to get his ETA. It still was longer than he stated each time. I had already explained to them what the issue was and where the pipe was located (roots growing in the line). I asked him if he wanted to come and see what was the issue from inside. He states that because I had told him what the issue was, he was 90% sure it was the same issue. He shoves a stick in the ground where I told him the line was located and says that it will be $460. I simply tell him I wasn\u2019t expecting to pay that much. I will give him the service fee so that he can head back home safely. I understood that there was a service fee, but I didn\u2019t receive any service at all. He did nothing other than stick a rod in the ground. He tells me that his company paid $112 to come out so I basically shouldn\u2019t complain about the $79. Also, due to him showing up several hours late, I wasn\u2019t able to contact any other businesses. He also spins out of my driveway after telling him I planned to leave this review. I respect the trade of a plumber wholeheartedly. I don\u2019t respect this one\u2019s way of making some easy money without doing anything.",
