He also went above and beyond what anyone would do and fixed a duct while he was in the crawlspace, put the feet back on my tub, pulled a rag out of my garbage disposal, and removed some dead rats out of the crawl space that he came across =O~. Not only that but he was polite and good with the kids and didn't overcharge. I'll definitely call him when I need something else!",
