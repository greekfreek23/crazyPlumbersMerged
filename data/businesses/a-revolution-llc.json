They put up fresh paint on the walls, crown molding, chair rail molding, and they regrouted the floor. They also put up a new light over the dining table and a new sink for the kitchen. They also sanded all of the cabinets and gave them some new paint and new fixtures, not to mention the curtain rods and curtains that they put up in the dining area. I could not be more happy! They use such care! My kitchen and dining area are now so beautiful that I want to show it off all the time! You would definitely never be unpleased with the work from James and Kaleigh!",
