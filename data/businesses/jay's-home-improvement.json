The water damaged my upstairs and downstairs flooring.  I called Jay's and not only did they jump right in to help, they completed this complex job in just a week.  They also worked with the Insurance company on my behalf for my claim.  They did a Great Job!!!!  My house looks great.  They even removed the popcorn texture in my Dining room and Kitchen and it looks awesome.  I recommend them to anyone that needs their help in water damage repair or any other repairs or improvements.  They also Really care for their customers.  Thanks to Jay's Home Improvement for making my home livable again!",

However, we went beyond what the insurance company was paying for for your mother. I was personally going to go to her property to see what else she wanted us to look at until you started calling our office making threats of violence, being belligerent and disrespectful to our staff. As owner I instructed our staff to not respond to you again. I also kept the screenshots and sent them to your mother's insurance company. The insurance company also agreed that you created a hostile environment and advised us to stay away from the property, as the work was in fact completed 6 months ago. However, I still wanted to help her. As I stated to you before, it is in our best interest to make every customer happy. However, we must ensure the safety of our staff as well. In response you called us cowards. Messages that I can post here if you'd like. Again, thank you for your review ",

Fence building is NOT their specialty so don\u2019t even try to get that type of service. Don\u2019t be fooled, they should have DECLINED the request! My mother should have known it was janky from the moment the owner wanted to charge to give her a quote! Usually a fence would take 2 days max to build out but this company took several. Most of that time was trying to figure out what to do! When they were finally questioned about the major gaps in the board the contractor got irate and quit on the job. When my mother asked about the deposit that she paid prior to them coming out they said nothing. Did not respond to the request of her receiving her deposit. They took 90% of the material that she paid for and quit 10% into the job. The level of unprofessionalism is WILD!  After they quit we had an inspection done because we needed someone to fix the terrible job that was done\u2026. The inspector advised that the post/fence be knocked down due to:\n1.) the spacing between the post\n2.) The post weren\u2019t in the ground far enough. (12 inches)\n3.) The height of the fence was more than 6ft\n4.) THE FENCE WAS OVER THE PROPERTY LINE!!!!\n\nAll of which was told to the contractor, when they were questioned about these issues the contractor quit! He was frustrated because he had to fix what he messed up. He did not check the property line before stating the job while the customer was out of town (which makes no sense!!). Why would you begin a job if you didn\u2019t know where to place the fence?!?? That is CRAZY!  Now the customer is stuck paying someone to fix these issues on top of rebuilding the fence. The contractor is refusing to respond to the request for the return of the deposit. Bottom line STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL, OVERPRICED, AND THE WORK IS TRASH!! 0/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!",
