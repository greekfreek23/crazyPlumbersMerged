We do apologize for the experience you had trying to obtain our services on your next project. Although words can never correct a negative experience we would still like to offer it sincerest regret for the inconveniences and expense incurred by our failure to fulfill our not only our obligation but our dedication to your repairs and satisfactory outcome. In no way to try and justify the poor experience you had, not to make excuses for our lack of communication but feel an explanation is due at the least. As we all learn life happens, schedules get busy, time gets away from us. Although this is solely our responsibility and poorly handled, myself and wife were involved In a horrific auto accident that left both of us on life support and multiple injuries requiring several surgeries and a long recovery. As this is a personal affair and our privacy and time to heal was an important part of our recovery, we feel that this could have been handled In a more appropriate manner and would like to make this right by fulfilling our agreement and obligation to you. While we don't expect you to forgive our lack of duty, we do sincerely hope you can accept our apology. We will be in touch soon or feel free to email us anytime @ shamrockhomerepairs@gmail.com",

      "text": "Has been a nightmare dealing with Raymond Roop of Shamrock Home Repairs!  He told me he had a ladder tall enough to replace my cathedral ceiling fan.  He did not.  Tried to work on it using a tall ladder on one of my plastic folding tables.  Of course, that is not stable enough. He cut the wires too short when taking down the existing fan and that caused problems.  He would say he was going to show up and work on it, and then not show up. (This happened several days.) Should have just said he couldn't do it.  Did not communicate well with me.  There were other projects I wanted him to do.  He did a few of those to begin with and I paid him, even though he said I wouldn't have to pay him until all the jobs were completed.  He asked for some money on the fan job the first day.  He got the fan partially installed but the wires were bunched up and shoved up in to the down rod. Installation not complete. Very unprofessional.  Very unreliable.  I would not recommend hiring him.",

      "responseFromOwnerText": "I'm sorry you feel this way. But let's be correct and truthful with our facts. For one you offered the money for the trouble of working on the installation that couldn't be done properly because you wanted to reuse the old housing junction box and downrod from prior fan. I told you upfront that I would try but couldn't guarantee much less warranty it being installed like that. I'm sorry I had a severe medical emergency and had to be away for two days which I told you at the start of the job that if I receive a call from the hospital I would have to go. The wires was not cut to short. That is the end of the wiring that extends from the ceiling to the end of the four foot downrod to the fan. The fan was disconnected and that is the wiring left to work with. This is why I suggested to have me come back to install the fan correctly from the ceiling. You agreed. I went to pick up there equipment for this. I contacted you to let you know of my status, I immediately contacted you soon as I learned from the rental place that I could not leave with the equipment with out first getting a truck large enough to safely transport it. I told you that I would make accomedations to do this first thing in the morning. Now without discussing this with me you choose to send me a text at 8pm telling me you don't want me to complete. Ma'am I'm sorry that you were inconvienced while trying to install the fan. I did mention to you at the time of the quote that I was backed up and it may be several days before I could get to you. Unless I did your projects in stages in my evening time after my already scheduled jobs. You said very kindly and several times assuring me that you were in no hurry and for me to only come when I have free time. I came two days later and completed your first set of five projects in the same day. It was agreed upon that even though I originally said payment could be done after completion of all projects. This was before I was informed that you had to special order the fan and delivery date was several days(week+) later than start date. We agreed it was no problem to combine the fan quote onto a separate invoice hence the uncertain shipping date. The remaining projects would be included on a individual invoice after completion of all said projects, which was. So, please don't assert that I insisted on being paid on a job before completion, I completed all work that I received payment on prior to receiving payment. The kind offer of $20 was made to me for the trouble of working on a fan that was impossible to install the method you wanted to use. I never insisted on you giving a payment on the fan for labor I didn't do. Once again I am truly sorry you are unhappy with your experience with us.",
