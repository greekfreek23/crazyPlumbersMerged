They were able to fit me into the schedule several days sooner than anyone else I talked with, and they were helpful to inform me of known and unknown potential expenses. When the details of a home warranty company came into play, they gave me some input and time to sort out the specifics in order to minimize the cost I had to bear. Nicholas even gave me some great guidance without hesitation on a few smaller plumbing projects I hoped to undertake by myself in the future. When dealing with something as important as water lines, I would much rather hire someone who does quality work than someone who just \"gets it done\" for cheap. Nevertheless, I felt like their service was a solid value and would absolutely call them again. The peace of mind of knowing a licensed pro completed the job and will stand by their work is worth a LOT. I would absolutely recommend S&S and Nicholas especially.",

During a leak detection service call, they went so far as to re-caulk certain tub fixtures while outright replacing a rusty old pipe that sent orange water into the bath when turned on. These additional touches weren't part of the service, but Nicholas quickly offered (without our asking) to replace and seal these fixtures as merely part of his visit. After trying other, bigger-name plumbing companies in the area, S&S was clearly the winner. Do yourself a favor and hire these plumbers if you want the job done thoroughly, correctly, and without a price tag that'll make you faint.",

Was very grateful.\n\nSent a text message on Monday to confirm the appointment for Wednesday and schedule the time to meet the plumber there\n\nAt 7pm I get a message back. Sorry, short a person and we cannot do the job.\n\n1.  I can understand you are short handed. But someone should have told me as soon as that happened. If I hadn\u2019t texted them, I would probably not even have known they were not coming until I sat in the driveway waiting for them the day of the appointment\n2.  No explanation on Why my job is the one that was dumped.  I tried to explain how this put me in a jam because I only have 30 days to reconcile the tenant\u2019s deposit and now I am scrambling to find someone else.   Didn\u2019t care.\n\n3.  I asked if he could refer someone else. I need this pressure test completed asap. He Stopped responding.\n\nI would not recommend this company to anyone.",

      "text": "Referred to S&S via my home warranty provider for repairs to my sump grinder pump. Technician was dispatched the very next day (Friday) and assessed the repair. Not including the service call fee, I was charged $250 to simply pump out the water from the holding tank. Was then charged to make the repairs and paid a final bill of $950. I would break down this total for you but I asked multiple times for a detailed invoice and was promised that one would be emailed to me, but I never received it. Two days later (Sunday) same issue started again and technician returned on Monday. Technician then stated  that I need a new sump pump with an estimated cost of $3500.\n\nMade the decision to contact my local utility company for input. Utility company dispatched a service tech immediately. Per utility company, I should have never contacted a private plumber since my home is connected to the utility sewar line. Utility company tech also looked at repairs supposedly done by S&S tech and stated they had to \"correct\" what he had attempted to do. Now, I understand that techs do things differently, but I just wanted to share what was told to me. Utility company tech repaired my sump grinder pump for a very fair price of $525...no new grinder pump required, only a couple of parts.\n\nFrom my perspective, S&S technician knew that I was not personally responsible for this repair and at most, I should have been charged a service call fee and/or diagnostic fee. When the S&S technician initially came to my home, I showed him a phone number on my sump pump alarm box and asked him if I should call them. He replied that he did not know why that message was on the box. Looking back, I should have followed my initial instinct to call.\n\nMy MAJOR issue with this vendor is that I am convinced that they knew that the utility company was responsible but instead treated this repair as if I as the owner should pay. In addition, still not clear how a final repair was done for $525 and S&S had me on the hook for nearly $4400 ($950 + $3450). When speaking with the utility company, even if I did need a brand new pump, the estimated cost was $1000 less that the S&S quote.\n\nAgain, while S&S did attempt to make the repairs for me, I just don't feel as if they were looking out for my best interest in their recommendations.",

      "responseFromOwnerText": "I\u2019m sorry you felt the need to poorly review our business, especially after we got to you on an emergency basis. Let me break it down here for you: there was an emergency diagnostic/trip fee of $300; there was a charge of $350 to evacuate sewage from the pit so the we could even diagnose the pump; there was a $300 charge to reconnect the drain lines that were disconnected because of they were under tension from the original installation position of the discharge line.\n\nI don\u2019t know how how we could have know that a utility board is supposed to be responsible for a sewage pump on your side of the meter, that seems like something a homeowner should be aware of. The utility company must have access to volume pricing on their parts, because my pump supplier couldn\u2019t access the float for the pump you have. The price I quoted you for a new pump installation was a good price. If you had someone who could do it for $1000 less that\u2019s fine, because $2500 doesn\u2019t even cover my price for pump and materials. I\u2019m not sure what more we could have done to serve your best interests, and I would urge you to remove this poor review due to the fact that we did everything within our power to assist you.",

I understood prices could vary but asked if he could give me any ballpark estimate of what I could expect. He refused to answer and repeatedly told me that I had a phone and could Google the prices myself. When I explained I couldn\u2019t research at the time and that his expertise would be very helpful, he replied saying to just Google when I had time.\n\nI am more than willing to pay a person and company for their time and labor, whatever that may be,  but expect them to be upfront about costs that I will be paying.

Eventually it will need a full replacement but given the renovation crew that redid this house for a broker did such a terrible job with gas lines surrounding the water heater, it was going to be a costly out of pocket replacement due to access issues. We\u2019re holding off until it\u2019s a must and will get things taken care of through our home warranty group.

Parts amounted to $96. Labor was charged at $450! That is the equivalent of $900 per hour! I paid the service tech thinking I would get this concern settled with the owner. However, my attempts to discuss the excessive labor charges were ignored. Their email (listed on the invoice that was emailed to me 3 days after service was performed), bounced back as invalid. No one answers the phone and my voice mails were not returned. They fixed my well pump problem, but at a very expensive price.",

We have used them at a rental property to find a specialty sized water heater to fit in a tiny closet with an indoor air handler (which would have taken days if we used someone else) and install it in the tight space. We needed them quickly to keep the renter happy and they went above and beyond for us. We also had them install and run a water line to a new refrigerator at our own home. Both times they showed up on time, were professional and finished the job to our liking. I would suggest them to my friends and family and we will use them in the future.",
