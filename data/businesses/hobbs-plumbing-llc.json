He did a fantastic job explaining why it was stuck, what he was doing, and the potential issues they could run into.  They prepared me for the worst but delivered the best!

I have had to call them multiple times for different things going on in my older house and they have come and fixed everything extremely quickly. Blake has always been very sweet and patient explaining everything to me. He not only found a rare part for my shower due to old pipes but made sure to give me the part info should I ever need another, but his company also came out to my house two days after Christmas to fix a busted pipe as planned but they also fixed my sink as well that they were not told about during the call and showed no irritation with this. So many other times they have come out due to old pipes that they have always gone above and beyond for my family. Highly recommend Hobbs Plumbing for any and all plumbing needs, They are amazing!",

      "text": "I own several rental properties in Auburn. I have been using Hobbs to do most of the work lately. There was an issue with a new bathroom faucet that was installed by Hobbs the week before, I paid $125. I noticed there was a problem with the new faucet handles being loose, they charged me another $125 to install another replacement. During the 2nd visit, the plumber left something black in the bottom of the bathtub, it looked like grease and dirt. When I cleaned it off, I saw a large chip at the bottom of the bathtub drain. This was not there before the plumber arrived. The plumber had lots of tools sitting on the side of the bathtub, which I believe fell and damaged the drain, but according the owner, the plumber claimed he didn't cause the damage. The drain damage was not there prior to the plumber arriving. The owner says that he believes the plumber and refuses to fix the drain damage without charging me additional money. I have no reason to lie about the drain damage. Clearly, customers are not that important to Hobbs. The owner was really rude, taking no responsibility for damage that was caused. Basically, the owner is saying I am lying. If there was damage to the drain, prior to the plumber coming, I would have gotten that fixed. It would not have cost me any more money because they charge $125 per hour and the plumber was on there 20 mins, replacing the faucet so why would I need to lie about damage to my drain. After this experience, I would not use this company again. The owner threatened to take me to collections, if I didn't pay the bill. I never said anything about not paying, but this is how rude and offensive he was to me. Horrible customer service and the lack of professionalism. The owner doesn't value his customers or doing what is right. He wasn't there, but clearly, he believes his plumber over a paying customer. He could have come out and corrected the problem at no charge, but he refused.  He was very offensive so I definitely wouldn't recommend this company, especially if they create other issues and problems while they are working at your home, they won't take responsibility and they will charge you to fix their mistakes.",

They send a young man named Bryan who found our busted pipe rather quickly, and then repaired it even quicker.  I could not be more pleased.  Two thumbs up, great experience and great customer service from this company.  Bryan is the man!  This is the only plumbing company I will use in the Auburn area for the foreseeable future!",
