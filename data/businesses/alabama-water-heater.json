      "text": "So my hot water heater decided to call it kaput two days before Thanksgiving. I called a couple places but they were super busy, and couldn\u2019t get out. I got referred to these guys and they came out the same day. My water heater was shot, and had to be replaced. Jarrett did a great job and cleaned up when he was done. Efficient and on time. I was so glad to have my hot water heater replaced right before the holiday- it would be horrible to have been without hot water on a major cooking holiday!",
