There are so many scams and bad people out there. Chris does an excellent job, detail oriented, tries to save money the best he can. Chris has helped me through emergencies and always shows up even though he is extremely busy. His skills as an electrician has been amazing in my kitchen in my open cabinets. Chris has the ability to \u201c work out\u201d problems in my home that I wanted but didn\u2019t think it was possible. Very good work, trustworthy and great pricing!",
