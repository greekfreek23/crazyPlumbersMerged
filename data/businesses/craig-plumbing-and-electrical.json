      "text": "I spent $400 in August to have 2 10' sections of pipe replaced in an accessible crawlspace.\nAfter a month of low pressure and warm water, I called to ask why they ran 1/2\u201d PEX between two 3/4\u201d pipes, dropping my pressure. He told me to clean my shower head. My next gas bill is 3X as high, and I'm using much more water, and a taller friend who could see the top of the water heater asked why my hot and cold were backwards. Now near the middle of October, I called about this, and when they fixed their reversal, they replaced my pop off valve because it was ragged. I call back in November because my drain is pouring cold water. They come back and replace the pop off and the thermostat saying it had been too high (imagine that: I had to turn the heater up because your idiots were mixing cold into my hot every time I turned it on), but then I told him it is still leaking, and it is still cold, and it is still from the VALVE THAT I SPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM WAS LEAKING AFTER HEARING IT THROUGH A STETHOSCOPE. One final visit, and they cut out the cold water overpressure drain pipe (that blew during the time it was hooked up wrong) and capped off the valve. The cap leaked in spite of the roll and a half of Teflon tape that they tried to squish into place, most not even wrapped in threads, just wrapped around the shank.\nIf you want a job done right *I* have to do it, I guess. Turns out that the valve has a proprietary fitting, and they just didn't want to pay to do the job right. How's that, Terry, when you charged me $400 to do everything wrong from the beginning? The owner is planning to run for mayor, and let me tell you: he is a perfect fit for the corrupt and crooked council in this town, overcharging for shoddy work, then auctioning off the work to someone else willing to work cheap and skimp on materials.\nCalling them is useless. You just have to wait until they call trying to get payment for a half-done job.\nI will NEVER do business with this company again.",

DO NOT use this company!!\nI paid this company in full over a thousand dollars in work when I moved into my home to have them replace my breaker panel box. When I had my inspection I was told the main thing I needed to have replaced in the home was that box because it was unsafe for my children and I . I called this company and they came out and worked on it and put a new one in for me.  Long story short the last two days I've been having very strange things happening with my electricity.  My fridge going out, my stove, my lights in my home. My tv turning on and off. I had a another person here working on my kitchen sink and he checked out the inside of the box for me and there's still old original unsafe wiring that I had paid that company to replace still in the box. I called the craig plumbing and electrical company and told him, (his name is Terry) about what was going on. He came about a hour ago checked it out and refused to do anything about it , would not take accountability for it, tried to blame me for the issue's. I'm a single mother with three girl's,  I know nothing about electrical work! That's Why I paid I thought were professionals to fix/ replace the issue.   And no one has touched that box since they worked on it. So I just want to warn people to be careful.",

When I\u2019ve tried contacting them for the refund that TERRY said they would send me back because they couldn\u2019t get out here in time, I hear nothing in return! It\u2019s been almost 2 months since. Check was supposedly sent out but it returned to sender\u2026. Still haven\u2019t seen any $ they owe me back and probably never will. Technically they stole from our family, that\u2019s who your hiring when you call Terry for your plumbing issues. Jeff and Tracey were good when they were here and worked their butts off, my issue is solely with Terry, the owner.\nMy 2 stars come solely from 1 having plumbing now and 2 Jeff and Tracey being wonderful at their jobs while also being friendly to my kids.",

When the day came, they were on time, and when they came across unexpected snafus they dealt with it at the same price they had quoted me originally. Also (mostly) cleaned up after themselves, didn't leave a huge mess for me to deal with. I've been recommending them to everyone I know, and will be calling them back for more work that needs to be done.",

The pvc pipe they glued in is still working and they assure me they'll repair it if it fails but I doubt they could have messed up gluing a pvc pipe. However I didn't expect them to be incapable of providing an itemized receipt so they definitely surprised me.\n\nWorth considering alternative providers.",
