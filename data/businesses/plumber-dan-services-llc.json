The leak in your crawlspace was on your incoming waterline not a copper waterline. It had leaked so much that Below your house was completely flooded. All the copper pipes were sweating Because of the water leak in the middle of July.\nThe PVC leak we repaired Looked like freeze damage from the winter before.\nAs for the price to replace a shower valve. That is a flat rate price. I\u2019m glad you were able to repair it.\nWe just always recommend replacement of older valves that aren\u2019t up to code. Faucets that aren\u2019t scald proof like yours. \nThank you. \nHave a great day!\n\n",

      "responseFromOwnerText": "First of all.  You have a home warranty that doesn\u2019t pay for secondary damage.  The tub drain was reset with new putty because it was leaking.  The home warranty also is the one responsible for the hole cut in the sheetrock not the plumbing company looking for the leak.  I don\u2019t know any plumbing company that does sheet rock. Also if you read your contract it doesn\u2019t pay for caulking because they can\u2019t warranty a sealing product. Basic maintenance such as caulking is part of home ownership.\nI\u2019m sorry you had a bad experience, but none of your complaints have anything to do with anything in our control. Thank you",
