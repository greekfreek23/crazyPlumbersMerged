      "text": "Randal Collier at Rocket City Home Repair:\nI had hired Randal to do some small jobs around my house previously, so when he learned I was planning to have my house painted and offered to give me a quote on it, I was happy to accept. His price was lowest of the bids I received and I hired him for the job. Almost immediately I started regretting it. After paying him $1000 up front to purchase paint and supplies, he then no showed for several days. Eventually he responded to my texts and said he had run out of money to purchase a paint sprayer and was working other jobs to get enough money for that. He had previously told me he had a paint sprayer and had painted at least one other house before.\n\nAfter work finally began it became very obvious that he did not know what he was doing. I repeatedly told him to arrive in the early mornings to paint as the daily temps were almost 100 degrees each day. He agreed but not once did he ever start work early - many days did not even arrive until afternoon. Then he wanted another $1000 because he didn't buy enough paint in the beginning and had no money to purchase more. At this point the painting was about 1/2 - 2/3 finished and wouldn't take more than 2 or 3 gallons of paint. I refused initially but since the job was taking so long, gave him another $500. He became upset on more than one occasion, raising his voice and arguing with me. Then since I didn't give him the entire $1000 he wanted, he did not speak to me at all and I never knew when he would show up to work.\n\nIt took about 3 weeks for him to do this job when everyone else who bid told me they would do it in 3 days. Also, he finished in the evening when I couldn't do a thorough check on his work. I even paid him extra because he was clearly in over his head and frustrated. The following day I found several problems with the paint job he did, including missing spots and paint overspray on my fence. Contacted him again and he said he would return to fix - twice he said he'd be here and never showed up.\n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND HIM!",
