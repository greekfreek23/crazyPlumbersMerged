Life happens, I get that. But don't waste folks time. Just be honest. Instead, I waited all afternoon and could have found someone else in the time I waited. (I called around 9AM that day.)",

I reached out to this company after researching plumbers in the Harris County area.  The guy came out and assessed the issue but stated he would need to come back the following day to repair the damages.  He stated he would be back at 2:30 p.m. I missed two hours of work to meet him at the house.  Needless to say, he never showed up nor did he call to say he couldn't make it.  I called the following morning to find out what happened but when the gentleman answered the phone and realized it was me, he hung up.  I should have known something was fishy about him when the water restoration company didn't know his company and they were from Harris County.  I learned that just because a company have a website doesn't mean they are about business.  Poor service!!",
