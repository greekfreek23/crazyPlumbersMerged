He was a referral from our HOA President, and consequently used primarily in our subdivision servicing $300k-600k+ homes and investment properties.  Ron\u2019s time in the plumbing industry, relationships, and time in the community make him an invaluable resource.  Over the past several months and especially during COVID shortages he has provided what seems to be an invaluable resource and that is peace of mind.  I can ask him to resolve anything from replacing a garbage disposal to fixing a fireplace (gas pipe) without having to follow-up with him.  He gets the job done, often goes beyond expectation, and is quick to communicate\u2026even when he just got out of the hospital.  I love this guy, and he reminds me why I miss my Southern Americans and their gracious inviting charm! -David Lanfkord Maj, USAF (ret)",
